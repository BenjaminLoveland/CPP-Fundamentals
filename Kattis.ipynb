    "- throughout these notebooks, you'll find Kattis problems listed under each chapter where appropriate\n",
    "- Kattis is a free problem bank and online judge that is widely used in [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/) around the world\n",
    "- Kattis is a great tool to learn various programming languages while solving intuitive problems and developing problem solving skills that are sought after by many potential employers\n",
    "- research (https://rambasnet.github.io/pdfs/kattis.pdf) has shown that by introducing and assigning Kattis problems motivates students to continuously use Kattis and solve more problems there by becoming an effecting problem solver -- a hallmark skill of computer scientist\n",
    "- here's a repository of some sample solutions provided in various languages with automated test cases: https://github.com/rambasnet/KattisDemos\n",
    "    - eventually (by Chapter 7), you'll be able to understand and use the all the programming concepts used in those demo solutions\n",
    "- use Kattis provided help to get your started: https://open.kattis.com/help\n",
    "- you must create a free acount here: https://open.kattis.com/login to be able to submit your solution so the Kattis can judge it with some verdict"
