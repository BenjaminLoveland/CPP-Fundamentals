    "- C++ is one of many tools computer scientists use to solve problems\n",
    "- learning and being proficient using your tools are important\n",
    "- ultimate goal is to learn problem solving like comupter scientists\n",
    "    - writing code, though important, is a small part of problem solving\n",

    "- a simple high-level approach to developing C++ programs is depicted in the following figure\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/CPPDevelopment.png\" width=\"35%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Define problem\n",
    "- figure out what problem are you trying to solve\n",
    "- may be be just an idea or fully researched problem statement\n",
    "    1. write a program to find the average temperatures in the USA over the last decade\n",
    "    - write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome\n",
    "    - write a program that finds the shortest path from New York City to San Francisco\n",
    "    - design and develop a system for Mars rover\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Step 2: Analyze problem\n",
    "- really understand the scope and all the parameters of the problem\n",
    "- gather all the requirements, outline any assumptions, input and output constraints, etc.\n",
    "    - let's say you want to solve the temperature problem #1 defined in step 1\n",
    "    - how'd you get the temperatures data? would you include all 50 states?\n",
    "    - what if there's no temperature data for some states? are you going to average out the states and then find the average of the average?\n",
    "    - are there any outliers, how'd you handle those?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Design solution\n",
    "- determine \"how\" you'd actually solve the problem\n",
    "- many ways to solve a problems; look into tradeoffs e.g. efficieny, cost, etc.\n",
    "    - often simple and straight forward solutions are better ones\n",
    "- break the problem into smaller modules or sub problem\n",
    "    - write algorithm steps for each sub problem\n",
    "    - modular solution is easier to update, expand, and reuse without affecting other parts\n",
    "- design mockups; draw system design\n",
    "    - explain how how various modules and components interact with each other\n",
    "    - helps address any assumptions made or limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Implement solution\n",
    "- write the program using a programming language \n",
    "    - use C++ in this course\n",
    "- programmers spend only about 20% of their time writing code\n",
    "- need a computer with a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n",
    "    - depends on the system: Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.\n",
    "- a good code editor or IDE typically provides\n",
    "    - way to organize project with multiple files and resources\n",
    "    - syntax highlighting, color coding, line numbers, easy way to compile, run and debug code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Build program\n",
    "- this is tpically a two step process:\n",
    "    1. compile c++ code in object or byte code\n",
    "        - a project may contain many c++ files (typically have .cpp or .cc file extensions)\n",
    "        - each C++ source file gets converted into object file (typically have .o extension)\n",
    "    2. linking object files and libraries\n",
    "        - program called linker combines or links together all the object files and C++ standard library and any other libraries used into one single executable program\n",
    "- modern compilers (e.g. g++) do the both the steps\n",
    "- **makefile** is another way to build C/C++ programs\n",
    "    - advanced concept we'll not cover in this course\n",
    "    - look it up if curious to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6, 7, and 8: Execute, Test, and Debug Program\n",
    "- you must execute or run the program to test it\n",
    "- a program called loader loads the executable into main memory RAM (Random Access Memory)\n",
    "    - CPU (Central Processing Unit) does the actual computation\n",
    "- testing makes sure you're getting right results under all the assumptions\n",
    "- programmers may spend a lot of time testing their own programs or others'\n",
    "- counter intuitively, you try to break your own program!\n",
    "- if bug or error exists, you need to pin point it and correct it\n",
    "    - build the program again repeating from step 5 as many times as required\n",
    "- couple common ways to test your program for correctness; learn both in this course!\n",
    "    1. manually run and feed input data and compare the results with the expected answers\n",
    "    - write test cases and test your program automatically using code\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 9: Deploy program\n",
    "- deliver or deploy your program in production environment\n",
    "    - given your program meets all the requirements, pases rigorous testing, etc."
