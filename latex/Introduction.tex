  hypothesis, and test predictions
\item
  \textbf{the single most important skill for a computer scientist is
  problem-solving mostly writing computer programs}

\item
  modern integrated development environemt (IDE) makes it very easy to
  compile, build and deploy C++ programs
\item
  however, the abstraction and easyness they provide may hide some of
  the important steps beginner programmer should know
\item
  the compilation process using Makefile is highly recommended for both
  beginners and the professionals in the field

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  programs often contains many types of errors called bugs
\item
  programmers spend majority of their time in testing their programs,
  finding bugs and getting rid of them
\item
  the process of finding and correting bugs is called debugging
\item
  many IDEs provide a way to step through the code and examine memory as
  the program executes
\item
  the key to finding and fixing bugs is testing

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    exhaustive testing makes sure program provides correct output for
    all sets of input

  also called syntax errors or grammatical errors
\item
  computer languages are formal languages with strict grammer to a
  semicolon

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Natural languages (English, e.g.) are full of ambiguity, redundancy
    and literalness (idioms and metaphors)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  compiler parses the C++ code; provides a list of errors if any
\item
  fails to compile a program to byte code if program has compiler error
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{run-time-errors}{%

    problem, solution, language quirks
  \end{itemize}
\item
  program runs fine but gives wrong answer

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    e.g., adding instead of multiplying to solve an equation (e.g.,
    \(2+2\) is same as \(2\times2\))
  \end{itemize}
\item
  can be identified and removed by doing adequate testing
