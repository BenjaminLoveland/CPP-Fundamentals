    "## Setting up Jupyter notebook learning environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook (popular tool in Data Science and Machine Learning) is merely a learning environment\n",
    "    - not a professional development environment esp. for C++ programs\n",
    "- see [README.md](https://github.com/rambasnet/CPP-Fundamentals) file for detail steps\n",
    "- allows you to interactively execute code, take notes with text and HTML, and embed multimedia files (image, audio, video, etc.)\n",
    "- most importantly, one can execute codes line by line and save the output result\n",
    "    - can focus on the the line of code to really master all the details and basics\n",
    "- you can also read and execute these notebooks from VS Code with right extensions\n",
    "- pdf version of these notebooks are provided in pdfs folder in the GitHub repository\n",
    "    - pdfs are readonly; can't write and/or execute embedded code in PDF files\n",
    "- GitHub (most of the time) renders these notebooks, so one can read the contents directly from GitHub repo\n",
    "    - readonly; can't execute embedded code on GitHub\n",
    "- follow the instructions from [https://github.com/rambasnet/DevEnvSetup](https://github.com/rambasnet/DevEnvSetup) to setup Jupyter Notebook on various platforms "
