    "## Headef Files and their purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "- we've used library header files such as iostream, string, etc.\n",
    "- the purpose of this chapter is to learn how to create your own header files and why\n",
    "- as program grows bigger, code need to be divided into many files\n",
    "- using function prototype (forward declaration) and defining functions after main is not scalable\n",
    "- breaking solution code into many files has many advantages:\n",
    "    - makes program easier to manage, read, update, debug\n",
    "    - makes it easier to work in a team where each member works on a separate file\n",
    "    - avoid conflicts while using version control such as git\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally, header files allow us to put declarations in one or more files and then include them wherever we need them\n",
    "    - this can save a lot of typing in multi-file programs\n",
    "    - helps us create our own library of important functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Creating header files\n",
    "- header best practices:\n",
    "    - header include guards (to avoid being included multiple times in the final binary)\n",
    "    - contains struct and class definitions\n",
    "    - contains function prototypes\n",
    "    - avoid function definitions\n",
    "    - may include other header files\n",
    "    - do NOT define global variables \n",
    "    - each header file should be as independent as possible with specific purpose\n",
    "    - file has `.h` extension\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Creating implementation files\n",
    "- typically a header file are implmented in a separate corresponding .cpp file\n",
    "- functions and classes are implmented or defined in implementation files\n",
    "- implementation file are regular .cpp files that must include the header being included\n",
    "- must also include any library header files required to implment the functions\n",
    "- syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include \"headerFileName.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Using header files\n",
    "- include user-defined header files similar to library header file\n",
    "- include only the header files that\n",
    "- syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include \"headerFileName.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- use the functions and user-defined types, etc. defined in the included header file\n",
